IT Will be a convenient way of commencing this Memoir to recite a well 
known dynamical proposition, and then to enlarge its enunciation by 
certain abandonment of restrictions. 

Suppose a rigid body free to rotate around a fixed point. There are in 
general three axes about any one of which the body will continue to rotate 
when once set in rotation so long as the application of force is withheld. 
These are known as the permanent axes. The freedom of the body in this 
case is of a particular nature, included in the more general type known as 
Freedom of the Third Order. This order is itself merely one subdivision 
of the class which, including the six orders of freedom, embraces every

614 SIR R. S . BALL On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 

conceivable form of constraint that can be applied to a rigid system. We 
propose to investigate the theory of permanent screws for a body con 
strained in the most general manner. 

The movement of the body must be a twist velocity about some one 
screw 0 belonging to a system of screws prescribed by the character of the 
constraints. In the absence of forces external to those arising from the 
reactions of the constraints, the movement will not, in general, persist as a 
twist about 8. The instantaneous screw will usually shift its position so as 
to occupy consecutive positions in the system. It will, however, be always 
possible to compel the body to remain twisting about 0. For this purpose 
a wrench of suitable intensity on an appropriate screw q may have to be 
applied. Without sacrifice of generality we can arrange that j is one of the 
system of screws which expresses the freedom of the body. It may some 
times appear that the intensity of the necessary wrench on rj vanishes. 
The body in such a case requires no external coercion to preserve 0 as the 
screw about which it twists, and we speak of 0 as a permanent screw. 

In the earlier parts of the Paper we may discard the restrictions 
involved in the assumption that the material system is only a single rigid 
body. The Theory of Screw-chains extends a portion of the inquiry to 
any material system whatever. Any number of parts connected in any 
manner must still conform to the general law, that the instantaneous move 
ment can always be represented by a twist about a screw-chain. Generally 
speaking, the position of the instantaneous screw-chain cannot be main 
tained without the imposition of special coercion. This is applied by a 
restraining wrench-chain, the relation of which to the instantaneous screw 
chain opens up an instructive branch of research. Sometimes we discover 
that a restraining wrench-chain is provided by the reaction of the con 
straints. The instantaneous screw-chain is then permanent, and we are 
thus led to the extension of the theory, to any mechanical system whatever. 

Another preliminary matter should be also noticed, because it exhibits 
the relation of the subject discussed in this Memoir to some other parts of 
the Theory of Screws. In the ordinary theory of the principal axes of a 
rigid body there are, as is well known, two distinct properties of such an 
axis which possess dynamical significance. We may think of a principal axis

as the axis of a couple which, when applied impulsively to the body, will set 
it spinning about this line. We may also think of the principal axis as a 
direction about which, if a body be once set in rotation, it will continue to 
rotate. When the first of these properties is suitably generalized it opens 
up the theory of principal screw-chains of inertia, which I have already 
explained in previous Memoirs. It is from the other property of the 
principal axis that the present theory takes its rise. The two general 
theories are wholly distinct in their mathematical treatment, and in the 
character of the conceptions to which they give rise. It is therefore to be 
observed that two different departments in the Theory of Screws happen to 
coalesce in the very special case of a rigid body rotating around a point. 

I. A PROPERTY OF THE KINETIC ENERGY OF A SYSTEM. 

It is obvious that a mere alteration of the azimuth about a fixed axis from 
which a rigid body is set into rotation will not affect its kinetic energy, 
provided the position of the axis and the angular velocity both remain 
unaltered. Enunciated in quite a general form the same principle is as 
follows 

Any mechanical system in movement is necessarily twisting about a 
screw-chain. If we arrest the movement of the system, displace it to an 
adjacent position on the same screw-chain, and then start the system to 
twist still on the same screw-chain, with its original twist velocity, the 
kinetic energy of the system is the same as it was originally. 

This principle requires that whatever be the symbols employed, T must 
satisfy a certain identical equation. I propose to investigate this equation, 
and its character will be best understood by discussing the question at first 
with co-ordinates of a perfectly general type for a system with n degrees of 
freedom. 

Let the co-ordinates be z1, ... xn as representing the position of the 
system, and of course its instantaneous velocity is indicated by Y, ...gin. 
Let 0 be the initial position of the system, then in the time t it has 
reached the position 0', whereof the co-ordinates are

616 SIR R. S. BALL-On the Theory of Permanent &rews. 

The movement from 0 to 0' must, like every possible movement of a 
system, consist of a twist about a screw-chain. This is a kinematical fact, 
wholly apart from the particular system of co-ordinates which may have 
been adopted. We call this screw-chain 0, and 0 denotes the twist velocity 
with which the system moves around it. 

Choose now any n independent screw-chains, about each one of which 
the system is capable of twisting. Then 6 can be decomposed into twist 
velocity components 0,, ... 0,, about the several screw-chains of reference. 

Since everything pertaining to the position or the movement of the system 
must necessarily admit of being expressed in terms of the co-ordinates of 
the system, and since the quantities 81, &c., 0., are definitely determined 
by the position and movements of the system, it follows that there must be 
a group of formulae 

01 =f(x, . . . .?;, . . . 
 

Sn fn(XII . . .27:, x1, . .. x.). 
Let the system now receive the small displacement 

82' &e, ... axe,  &"86 
where 8c is a small quantity, and let it be set in motion so that it has the 
same twist velocity as before, about the same screw-chain as before. The 
test of this is that each of the quantities O,, O,, is to remain unaltered. 
This can only be arranged by a suitable accommodation of &x?, ... &x, in 
accordance with the equations

We have also the equation arising from the circumstance that T has not 
altered, so that

SIR R. S. Bar.-On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 617 

Let us assume, for brevity, the symbol A, such that

Such is a general condition to be satisfied by T ; and it is of some 

interest to notice that the expression for the kinetic energy of any system 
is constrained to obey the law that is implied. It is doubtless true that 
the equation is a complicated one in ordinary systems of co-ordinates. 
It is, however, a distinctive feature of the Theory of Screw-chains to 
exhibit this equation in a form of much simplicity. 

For, suppose that 

On  X ., 

then the equation above written reduces to 

AT 0. 

We thus have the following theorem : 

If the co-ordinates of a system f',, ... 8',i be the n twists about n screw 
chains, belonging to the system of screw-chains which express the liberty 
of the system, and if fix, ... O,, be the twist velocities of the system about 
these screw-chains, then the kinetic energy T satisfies the equation

618 SIR R. S. BALL---On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 

I have thought it more instructive to exhibit the origin of this equa 
tion as a special case of the general type of co-ordinates. For a brief 
demonstration the following simple argument suffices : 

If the system be displaced through 8O',, ... S8'n while the velocities are 
unaltered, the change of kinetic energy is 

dT dT 
d8 d8n 

If the change of the position be that of a small twist around 8, ... Ott, 
then 

&&  

0"Se  80"" 

but from the physical property of the kinetic energy already cited, it appears 
that this arrangement cannot change the kinetic energy, whence 

 dT dT 
d8z dfn 

The converse of this theorem will now be proved ; but before doing 
so it will be necessary to call attention to a point in the philosophy of 
co-ordinate systems of any type whatever. Let us take the general case 
where the co-ordinates are x1, ... x., and xj, ... x. Suppose that x2, ... &n 
are all zero, then is the velocity of the system. We shall also take a2, ... xn 
to be zero, so that we only consider the position of the system defined by x?. 
Think now of the two positions for which x,  0 and x,  x'i, respectively. 
Whatever be the character of the constraints it must be possible for the 
system to pass from the position z  0 to the position x,  z'1 by a twist 
about a screw-chain. The magnitude x'l is thus correlated to the position 
of the system on a screw-chain about which it twists. 

Let us suppose that the co-ordinates are of such a kind that the identical 
equation which T must necessarily satisfy has the form 

.dT , dT X 1 d.. , 
 

, dx,  0. am n

SIR R. S. BALL-On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 619 

Then, for the particular displacement corresponding to the first co-ordinate, 
Z2, ... x,, are all zero, and 

dT 
-0; d2;'1 

and as T must involve xl in the second power, we have 

T  Hxl2, 
where H is independent o x'l. 

Let 0, be the twist velocity about the screw-chain corresponding to the 
first co-ordinate, then, of course, A being a constant, 

T A&2, 
whence 

At12=H'?12I 

'Y ':& 1  '/.LZ x?, l 
whence by integration and adjustment of units and origins 

01=x1. 

We thus see that while the displacement corresponding to the first co-ordi 
nate must always be a twist about a screw-chain, whatever be the actual 
nature of the metric element chosen for the co-ordinate, yet that when the 
identical equation admits of the form 

. dT .dT 
o, ...  on  o, dB's dB' 

the metric element chosen can be nothing else than the amplitude of the twist 
about the screw-chain. 

We have thus proved the following general theorem : 
If the identical equation, satisfied by T, admits of expression in the form 

dT .dT 
doll d?'fs 

then the co-ordinates must be twists about n screw-chains of reference. 
It is worth noticing that the identical equation in this form is indepen 

dent of linear transformation.

Suppose, for instance, we write

Then, by differentiation

linear transformations

The expression admitting of this property is known in algebra as an 
emanant. 

We could, however, have foreseen the permanence of the form of the 
identical equation from the fact, that if any set of n independent screw 
chains belonging to the system be chosen, the equation must assume this 
form. 

The existence of such a simple mode of expression for this property of 
T, suggests the natural character of screw-chain co-ordinates. 

II.----THE GENERAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION WITH SCREW-CHAIN CO-ORDINATES. 

Let the components of the wrench-chain, when resolved on the screw 
chains of reference, have for intensities -q",, r?". Let p1, ... p,, be the 
pitches of the chains of reference, by which is meant that 2p, is the work 
done on that screw-chain by a twist of unit amplitude against a wrench of 
unit intensity on the same screw-chain. Then, choosing a set of co-reci 
procal screw-chains of reference, we have, from Lagrange's equations,

be co-reciprocal. If, however, we select that particular group which forms 
the principal screw-chains of inertia, then every pair are conjugate screw 
chains of inertia besides being reciprocal.

III.-THE RESTRAINING WRENCH-CHAIN. 

If a system be twisting about a screw-chain 0, where no external forces 
are in action, the system will, in general, forsake 0 and gradually adopt 
one screw-chain after another. It is, however, possible, by the application 
of a  suitable wrench-chain to compel the system to keep to 0. We call 
this the restraining wrench-chain, and we proceed to study its character. 

The co-ordinates of the wrench-chain required are obtained by imposing 
the conditions

are the co-ordinates of the restraining wrench-chain which would coerce 
the system into continuing to twist about the same screw-chain O. 

We obtain a confirmation of this theorem by the following method of 
viewing the subject. It must be possible to coerce the system to twist 
about 0 by the imposition of special constraints. The reactions of these 
constraints will constitute, in fact, the restraining wrench-chain. It is, 
however, a characteristic feature that, as the system is, ex hypothesi, still 
at liberty to twist about 0, the reaction of any constraints which are con 
sistent with this freedom must lie on a screw-chain reciprocal to 0. 

The condition that two screw-chains, 0 and rq, shall be reciprocal is

but this is clearly satisfied if for rqj, &c., we substitute

This gives a physical meaning to the en .avant identity, which, as we have 
seen, is characteristic of screw-chain co-ordinates. From this point of view 
it becomes merely an expression of the fact that the restraining wrench 
chain must be reciprocal to the instantaneous screw-chain. 

The kinetic energy will remain unaltered by a derangement of the

IV.--THE ACCELERATING SCREW-CHAIN. 

When the system has forsaken the instantaneous screw-chain 0, and 
advanced to another screw-chain 0, there must be a twist velocity about some 
screw-chain p, which, when compounded with the twist velocity about 0, 
gives the twist velocity about 4. When 4 and 0 are indefinitely close, then 
p is the accelerating screw-chain.

the screws of reference. If external forces are absent, we have

We can prove this otherwise, as follows :---- 
From the theory of screw-chains it is known that if a quiescent system 

receive an impulsive wrench-chain with co-ordinates 

U2 u?b 
. I pt; Pn, 

the system commences to twist about the screw-chain, of which the co-ordi 
nates are 

If, by the imposition of a restraining wrench, the system continues to 
remain twisting about 0, the restraining wrench has neutralized the 
acceleration ; it follows that the restraining wrench-chain, regarded as 
impulsive, must have generated an instantaneous grist velocity on the 
accelerating screw-chain, equal and opposite to the acceleration that would 
otherwise have taken place. The co-ordinates of this impulsive wrench are 
proportional to 

1 dT 1 dT 
pi d0lj' 

'   

pn d8',?' 

The corresponding instantaneous screw-chain is obtained by multiplying 
these expressions severally by 

P1 Pu 21 ' q21 U Un 

and thus we find, as before, for the co-ordinates of the accelerating screw 
chain 

1 dT 1 dT 
U 2 (1B,I ..  u,2 de'n. 

We can now express the relation between the accelerating screw-chain 
and the instantaneous screw-chain.

626 SIR R. S. BALL-On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 

We have, from the expressions already given, 

. .. ... . dT . dT 
M(2G12 UiO  . . .  u2  V1   . . on --f-. dB, od8 

But the right-hand side is the emanant which we know to be zero, whence 

U2 8181  &c.,  UJy2 09L en  0. 

This shows that 8i, ... 8n, and 81, ... 0. are on conjugate screw-chains 
of inertia, and hence we infer that when a mechanical system is moving 
without external forces, the instantaneous screw-chain and the accelerating 
screw-chain are conjugate screw-chains of inertia. 

The construction of the accelerating screw-chain is thus obtained :-- 
When a single rigid body is in movement a cylindroid can be drawn 

through two consecutive instantaneous screws, and this cylindroid osculates 
the motion. We can thus conceive a chain of cylindroids osculating the 
movement of any system whatever. If an instantaneous screw chain 0 be 
chosen on these cylindroids, then it is always possible to inscribe on the 
same cylindroids one, but only one screw-chain, which is conjugate to 0 
with respect to inertia. This is the accelerating screw-chain. 

V. PERMANENT SCREWS. 

Reverting to the general system of equations, we investigate the condi 
tion that 0 shall be a permanent screw. It is obvious that if O, 82, &c., 8 
are all zero, then

each vanish.

should be zero. Remembering that T is a homogeneous function in the 
second degree of the quantities 0,, ... 0,,, the evanescence of the deter 
minant just written would indicate that T admitted of expression by means 
of n  1 square terms, such as 

 L12  42 . , .  Ln2_1. 
This vanishes if 

L,  o ; 4  0, c. ; Ln_1 0; 
each of these is a linear equation in 0,, ... 0,,, and consequently a real 
system of values for 01, 8,z must satisfy these equations, and render T zero. 
It would thus appear that a real motion of the system would correspond to 
a state of zero kinetic energy. This is, of course, impossible ; it therefore 
follows that the determinant must not vanish, and consequently we have 
the following theorem : 

If the screw-chains of reference be co-reciprocal, then the necessary and 
the sufficient conditions for 0 to be a permanent screw are indicated by the 
equations 

dT dT 
d8, d8n 

There are n of these equations, but they are not independent. The emanant 
identity shows that if n  1 of them be satisfied, the co-ordinates so found 
must, generally speaking, satisfy the last equation also. 

As the quantities O'l, ... e' are small, we may generally expand T in 
powers, as follows 

T  Tp  81T1  . . . V'nT,

The equation

therefore becomes 
T,+20',T11+2O'2T12 1 ...-=0, 

and as O',, O', &c., are indefinitely small, this reduces to 

T1  0, 

where T1 is a homogeneous function of B,, 02, ... 8,z in the second degree. 
For the study of the permanent screws we have, therefore, n equations 

of the second degree in the co-ordinates of the instantaneous screw-chain, 
and any screw-chain will be permanent if its co-ordinates render the several 
differential coefficients zero. We may write the necessary co-ordinates that 
have to be fulfilled, as follows :- 

Let us denote, by Roman capitals, the several differential coefficients 
of T with respect to the variables. Then the emanant identity is 

011  d211  03 111     =o, 

and we may develop any single expression, such as III, in the following 
form : 

III - III,1 &2  "22021  11133 032  211112&02  ... 211I,4 0104. 

As the emanant is to vanish identically, we must have the coefficients of 
the several terms, such as 813, 01282, 010283, &c., all zero, the result being 
three types of equation

VI. -A SINGLE FREE RIGID BODY. 

In the case of a single free rigid body there is another identical equa 
tion besides that implied in the vanishing of the emanant. The origin of 
this equation is thus explained :- 

Let T be the kinetic energy of a free rigid body twisting for the moment 
around a screw 0. It is obvious that T will be a function of the six co-or 
dinates, B',, ... O', which express the position of the body, and also of 
O1, ... Bs, the co-ordinates of the twist velocity, 

T?fe'1,... e'6, e1,...es). 
It is plain, from symmetry, that the kinetic energy will be unaltered if the 
motion of the body be arrested, and if, after having received a displacement 
by a twist of any pitch on the same axes as the instantaneous screw, it be 
again set in motion with the primitive twist velocity. Let E be the ampli 
tudd of the twist, then the obvious property which we have just stated 
involves the following analytical property :---- 

That T must remain unchanged if we substitute as follows, for &', 

px dB 
'? 81 -? ---' . E, 4p dO 

and similarly for 0'2, &C., 0'6. 

In these expressions px denotes an arbitrary pitch, while R is the function 

012 -? 022 ...  062+2(12)d102+2(23)d2 03, &c., 
where (12 is the cosine of the angle between the first and second screws of 
reference, and similarly for (23), &c. 

Substituting in T, we obtain

As this must be true for every value of px, we must have, besides the 
vanishing emanant, the condition 

1 dR dT 1 dR dT 
p d0i 1 p6 d0fi 6 

It is clear that the form of T must be such as to satisfy this equation. 
The physical meaning of this equation is easily obtained, for it may be 

written thus,

P1--;X-T+... CL?  p6

and the screw of which the co-ordinates are 
1 dT 1 dT 

pl GtV`, 
. 

P6 d 8'6 
must be reciprocal. 

The former denotes a screw of infinite pitch parallel to 0, the latter 
denotes the restraining screw. The result may be thus stated : 

The restraining screw corresponding to any given instantaneous screw 
is the same for any other instantaneous screw on the same axis of any 
pitch whatever. 

We now compute the co-ordinates of the restraining wrench for a free 
rigid body. 

Suppose the body to have a standard position from which we displace it 
by small twists O',, ... e'6 around the six principal screws of inertia. While 
the body is in this position it receives a twist velocity of which the co-ordi 
nates relatively to the six principal screws of inertia are 8i, ... B6. 

To compute the kinetic energy we proceed as follows :-Let a point lie 
initially at x, y, z, then, after the displacement of the system prior to 
starting, it is moved to X, Y, Z, where

and

but this is shown otherwise to be true, because the restraining screw must 
be reciprocal to the instantaneous screw. 

These equations enable us to study the correspondence between each 
instantaneous screw 0 and the corresponding restraining screw . It is to 
be noted that this correspondence is not of the homographic, or one-to-one 
type, such as we meet with in the study of the Principal Screws of Inertia, 
and in other parts of the Theory of Screws. The correspondence now to 
be considered has a different character. 

If any 0 be given, then, no doubt, one q is given definitely, but the 
converse is not true. If rq be selected arbitrarily there will not in general 
be any possible 0. If, however, there be any one 0, then every screw on 
the same axis as 0 will also correspond to the same q.

It might have been thought that any screw could be the residence 
of a restraining wrench, provided the corresponding instantaneous screw 
were fitly appointed. On the other hand it would be noted that to each 
restraining screw must correspond a singly infinite number of possible 
instantaneous screws. As the choice of an instantaneous screw had five 
degrees of infinity, it was to be presumed that the restraining screws could 
only have four degrees of infinity, Z. e. that the co-ordinates of a restraining 
screw must satisfy some equation, or, in other words, that they must belong 
to a screw system of the fifth order, as we have now shown them to do. 

We can obtain a confirmation of the expression for the co-ordinates of 
r in a somewhat interesting manner. It is obvious, from the physical 
aspect of the question, that so long as 8 retains the same direction and 
situation, its pitch is immaterial so far as q is concerned. For the rigid 
body twisting about a screw has no tendency to depart from the screw in 
so far as its velocity of translation is concerned. It is the rotation which 
necessitates the restraining wrench if the motion is to be preserved about 
the same instantaneous screw. We ought, therefore, to find that the 
expressions for the co-ordinates of q remained unaltered if we substituted

relation of instantaneous to impulsive, but in the case supposed these two 
screws are reciprocal, therefore they cannot be so related, and therefore 
there is no acceleration.

SIR R. S. BALL--- On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 637 

VII.----Two DEGREES OF FREEDOM. 

We now commence to investigate the circumstances with regard to a 
constrained system. There is nothing to be said as to the restraining 
wrench when the freedom is of the first order. Of course, in this case, as 
every movement of the body can only be a twist about the screw which 
prescribes its freedom, the restraining wrench is provided by the reactions 
of the constraints. It is only where the body has liberty to abandon its 
original instantaneous screw that the theory of the restraining wrench 
becomes significant. 

If a rigid body has two degrees of freedom, then it is free to twist about 
every screw on a certain cyliiidroid. If the body be set initially in motion 
by a twist velocity about some one screw on the surface, then, in general, 
it will not remain twisting about this screw. A movement will take place 
by which the instantaneous axis gradually comes into coincidence with 
other screws on the cylindroid. If we impose a restraining wrench q, of 
course 0 can be maintained as the instantaneous screw ; rq is reciprocal to 0. 
It may be compounded with any reactions of the constraints of the system. 
Thus, given 0, there is an entire screw system of the fifth order, any one 
screw of which may be taken as the restrainer. Of this system there is one, 
but only one, which lies on the cylindroid itself. There are many 
advantages in taking it as the restraining wrench, and it entails no sacrifice 
of generality ; we therefore have the following statement :-To each screw 
on the cylindroid, regarded as an instantaneous screw, will correspond one 
screw, also on the cylindroid, as a restraining screw. A 

The position of this restraining screw is found, 
at once, by the property that it must be reciprocal o 
to the instantaneous screw. If we employ the cir 
cular representation for the screws on the cylindroid R 

(fig. 1), and if 0 be the pole of the axis of pitch, 
then it is known that the extremities of any chord, 
such as IR drawn through 0, will correspond to 
two reciprocal screws. If therefore I be the instan Fig. I. 
taneous screw, then l must be the restraining screw. If a body be set in

motion by a twist velocity about I, it will be possible, by a suitable wrench 
applied on the screw corresponding to R to compel the body to continue 
to twist about I. 

Let 0' be the pole of the axis of inertia, then, if IA be a chord drawn 
through 0', the points I and A correspond to a pair of conjugate screws of 
inertia. It further appears that A is the instantaneous screw corresponding 
to an impulsive wrench on R. Therefore the effect of the wrench on R 
when applied to control the body twisting about I is to compound its 
movement with a nascent twist velocity about A. Therefore A must be 
the accelerating screw corresponding to I. We thus see that 

D, f two conjugate screws of inertia, for a rigid system with two degrees of free 
dom, either is the accelerator for a body animated by a twist velocity about the 
other. 

In the case of freedom of the second order we are enabled to obtain the 
form of T, from the fact that the emanant vanishes, that is, 

 dT dT 
d81 d82 

If we assume that T is a homogeneous function of the second degree in 
0, and 82, the solution of this equation gives 

T-L8l2+258182+Xd2l+H(B'1 2-02d,)' (0'1d2  0'201 (Ad,  B02)0 
If we further suppose that O' and O' are so small that their squares may be 
neglected, then the term multiplied by .-.1 may be discarded, and we have 

T =.L192+2SOI 2+Me22 (0'102""e'2O1)(AO}+Bv2),

We now write the equations of motion for a body with two degrees of 
freedom, and unacted upon by any force, the reference being made to the 
principal screws of inertia.

There must be one screw on the cylindroid, for which 

A01+B62=o. 

This screw will have the accelerations Bl and U2, both zero, and thus we 
have the following theorem : 

If a rigid system has two degrees of freedom, then, among the screws about 
which it is at liberty to twist, there is one, and in general only one, which has the 
property of a permanent screw. 

The existence of a single permanent screw in the case of freedom of 
the second order seems a noteworthy point in abstract Dynamics. The 
analogy here ceases entirely between the permanent screws and the prin 
cipal screws of inertia. Of the latter there are two on the cylindroid. 

Let N (fig. 2 be the critical point on the circle which corresponds to

the permanent screw. Let P be a screw 0, the twist velocity about which 
is O. Let ue be a linear parameter appropriate to the screw 0, such that 
Mue2e2 is the kinetic energy. 

If the body be set twisting about N it will stay there. If set twisting 
about any other screw 0 the instantaneous screw will gradually change. 
We shall first study the rate at which the instantaneous screw shifts its 
position. 

Let Q be an adjacent position, then, by Ptolemy's theorem,

which is, accordingly, the rate at which P will change its position. If we

N. If p be zero, then the expression for this velocity vanishes. This means 
that P has no tendency to abandon N; in other words, that the screw 
corresponding to Nis permanent. 

We may present the velocity of P in a purely geometrical aspect, as 
follows :--Let XT(fig. 3 be the axis of inertia, then ue2 is proportional to the

perpendicular from P on T. It follows that the velocity of P for a given 
twist velocity is proportional to the product of PN and PT. 

If a' be the pole of XT with regard to the circle, then the acceleration 

Fig. 3. 

is a twist about the screw corresponding to Q, and the magnitude of the 
acceleration varies as 81 x P 0' x P.N. 

The importance of the theory relating to the existence of a single per 
manent screw on the cylindroid makes it worth while to investigate the 
question from another point of view. 

Let us think of any cylindroid 8 placed quite arbitrarily with respect to 
the position of the rigid body. A. certain restraining screw eq will corre 
spond to each screw 0 on S. As 0 moves over the cylindroid, so must the 
corresponding screw rq describe some other ruled surface S'. The two 
surfaces, 1S' and i, will thus have two corresponding systems of screws, 
whereof every two correspondents are reciprocal. One screw can be 
discovered on S', which is reciprocal, not alone to its corresponding 0, but

to all the screws on the cylindroid. A wrench on this Pq can be provided 
by the reactions of the constraints, and, consequently, the constraints will 
in this case, arrest the tendency of the body to depart from 0 as the 
instantaneous screw. It follows that this particular 0 is the permanent 
screw. 

We can obtain some interesting results by performing the actual calcu 
lation of the relations between q and the cylindroid. 

A set of forces applied to a rigid system has components X, Y, Z at a 
point, and three corresponding moments F, G, H in the rectangular planes 
of reference. 

Let p be the pitch of the screw on which the wrench thus represented 
lies, and let x, y, z be the co-ordinates of any point on this screw. Then, 
in the plane of Z the moments of the forces are x Y  yX, and if to this be 
added pX, the whole must equal H. 

Thus we have the three equations, so well known in statics, 

F=pX+yZ--zY, 

G=pY+zX-2Z, 

H=pZ+xY----yX. 

The centrifugal acceleration on a point P is, of course, co2PH, where w is 
the angular velocity, and PH the perpendicular let fall on the axis. The 
three components of this force are X', Y', Z', where 

X'  0 sin 8 (x sin 8 y cos 0), 
Y'  0)2 cos B (y cos 0  x sin 0), 
Z' 

=CO2(s  m sin 20), 
and the three moments are I", G', H' where 

F'  w2 sin B (yz sin B  xz cos 0  2my cos 0), 
G'  W0 cos e (---- yZ sin 0  xz cos 0  2mx sin 0), 
S'  w2 ((y'  x2 sin 0 cos 0  xy cos 28).

we find, after a few reductions, 

tan3 c (YV  G U  tan2 4 (X V  FU  2mX U

This cubic corresponds, of course, to the three generators of the cylindroid

If we put

then the cubic becomes, by eliminating m, 

(Ytan+X)(X(YV G U tans hb  (X V  .Z'U Y  0. 
The factor Y tan 0  X simply means that the restraining screw cuts the 
instantaneous screw at right angles. 

The two other screws in which 77 intersects the cylindroid are given by 
the equation 

(XYV - X G U tan2  (XYV  FUY  0. 
These two screws are of equal pitch, and the value of the pitch is

This is the pitch of the two equal pitch screws on the cylindroid which I 
intersects. If rj is to be reciprocal to the cylindroid, then, of course, the 
pitch of , itself should be equal and opposite in value to this expression. 
Hence the permanent screw on the cylindroid is given by

We notice here the somewhat remarkable circumstance, that if

646 Sri R. S. BALL On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 

It hence appears that if two screws on a cylindroid are permanent, then 
every screw on the cylindroici is permanent. 

The investigation of these points opens up an interesting theory which 
we do not here further refer to. 

VIII. THREE DEGREES OF FREEDOM. 

Let us now specially consider the case of a rigid body which has 
freedom of the third order. On account of the evanescence of the emanant 
we have 

 dT  dT  dT 
d8I dU 2 dJ3 

It is well known that if U, V, W be three conics whose equations submit to 
the condition 

xU+yV+zW=0, 
those conics must have three common intersections. 

It therefore follows that the three equations 
dT dT dT 
dO, de2 d0'30 

must have three common screws. These are, of course, the permanent 
screws, and, accordingly, we have the theorem 

A rigid system which has freedom of the third order has, in general, three 
permanent screws. 

There will be a special convenience for the study of the subject in 
taking these three screws as the screws of reference. We shall use the 
plane representation of the three-system, and the equations of the conics 
will be

identically we must have

For symmetry we may write 

A, p, -v, B2=v-X; C?=X--r p,.

where

For further development we now employ the plane representative of the 
system of the screws. We learn that rq must lie on the polar of the point 
01, 82, 03 with respect to the pitch conic, or the locus of all the screws for which 

We also see that 
-9 must lie on the polar of the point a01, /302, yOa with 

regard to the pitch conic. 
We thus obtain a geometrical construction by which we are enabled 

to discover the restraining screw when once the instantaneous screw is 
given. 

Two homographic systems are first to be conceived. A point of the 
first system, of which the co-ordinates are 01, 02, 03 has as its correspondent 
a point in the second system, with co-ordinates aO,, /302, 703. The three 
double points of the nomography correspond, of course, to the permanent 
screws.

SIR R. S. BALL-On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 649 

To find the restraining screw corresponding to a given instantaneous 
screw 0, we join 0 to its homographic correspondent, and the pole of this 
ray, with respect to the pitch conic, is the position of rq. 

The pole of the same ray, with regard to the conic of inertia, is the accele 
rator. It seems hardly possible to have any more vivid geometrical picture 
of the relation between r and 9 than that which these theorems afford. 

We have already shown that there is a single steady screw in every 
mechanical system with two degrees of freedom. We can demonstrate this 
in a different manner as a deduction from the case of the three-system. 

Consider a cylindroid in a three -system, i. e. a straight line AB (fig. 4). 
If the movements of the body 0 eP 
be limited to twists about the 
screws on the cylindroid, there 
will be reactions about the pole 
of this ray P with respect to A o 
the pitch conic, in addition to 
the reactions of the three 
system. `o 

The permanent screw on Fig.4. 
this cylindroid will be one whereon the restraining screw coincides with P. 
In general, the homographic points corresponding to the points on the ray 
AB will form a ray C.D. The intersection 0, regarded as on CD, will be 
the correspondent of X on AB. The restrainer corresponding to X will 
therefore lie at P, and will be provided by the constraints. Accordingly, 
X is a permanent screw on the cylindroid, and it is obvious from the 
construction that there can be no other screw of the same character. 

We can also deduce the expression for T in the two-system, from the 
expression of the more general type in the three-system ; for we have 

T  To  (,a V e'182e3  {v - X O'20301  (X  i e'3e1e2.

which we already know to be the form of the function in the case of the 
two-system. 

IX. REMAINING DEGREES OF FREEDOM. 

The permanent screws in freedom of the fourth order are to be investi 
gated in the following manner :-If a screw 0 be permanent, the corre 
spond.ing 'q must be provided by the reactions of the constraints. All the 
reactions in freedom of the fourth order lie on the screws of a cylindroid. 
On a given cylindroid three possible r screws can be found. For, if we 
substitute a,  X/1, a2  X/32, &c., for , -q,, &c., in the equation 

b2-c2'1I?'-'p12 c2-a2 _13-x-_14 a2-b2 _15+_16 
a 711 - 712 b 13 - 'p14 c 775 - r16 

we obtain a cubic for X. The three roots of this cubic correspond to three r 
screws. Take the 0 corresponding to one of the screws, then, of course, 
0 will not, in general, belong to the four-system. We can, however, assign 
to 0 any pitch we like, and as it intersects -q at right angles, it must cut two 
other screws of equal pitch on the cylindroid. Give to 0 a pitch equal and 
opposite to that of the three latter screws, then 0 is reciprocal to the 
cylindroid, and therefore it belongs to the four-system. We thus have a 
permanent screw of the system, and accordingly we obtain the following 
result : 

In the case of a rigid body with freedom of the fourth order there are, in general, 
three, and only three, permanent screws. 

In freedom of the fifth order, the screws about which the system can be 
twisted are all reciprocal to a single screw p. In general, p does not lie 
on the system prescribed by the equation which all possible co-ordinates 
satisfy. It is therefore, in general, not possible that the reaction of the 
constraints can provide an -q. There are, however, three permanent screws 
in the five-system, the existence of which is thus demonstrated :-Draw 
through the centre of inertia of the body the three principal axes, then, on

SiR R. S. BALL On the Theory of Permanent Screws. 651 

each of these axes one screw can always be found which is reciprocal to p. 
Each of these will belong to the five-system, and it is obvious from the 
property of the principal axes, that if the body be set twisting about one 
of these screws it will have no tendency to depart therefrom, and no call 
is made on the constraints to provide a restraining wrench. 

If the body have freedom of the sixth order it is then perfectly free. 
Any screw on one of the principal axes through the centre of inertia is a 
permanent screw, and, consequently, there is in this case a triply infinite 
number of permanent screws. 

The results obtained show that for a rigid body with the several degrees 
of freedom the permanent screws are as follows :
